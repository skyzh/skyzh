Hi, I'm Alex Chi, currently a first-year master's student in Carnegie Mellon University.

- I'm currently maintaining [RisingLight](https://github.com/risinglightdb/risinglight), an educational OLAP database system.
- I'm also working on [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub) as a teaching assistant for CMU's intro to database course.
- I'm interested in exploring how to productively use the Rust programming language in data-intensive applications. For example, [type-exercise-in-rust](https://github.com/skyzh/type-exercise-in-rust) is a tutorial for building a vectorized expression evaluation framework in database systems with Rust.
- You can sponsor me to build better database systems, craft wonderful education materials, and explore how the Rust programming language fits in the database world.
- ... by buying me [bubble tea in Pittsburgh](https://www.toasttab.com/fuku-tea/giftcards), which makes me productive when coding. *(I'm not allowed to get money as an international student in the US.)*
