Hi, I'm Chi, currently working [@neondatabase](https://github.com/neondatabase). I spent most of my life in Shanghai, and now I'm living in Pittsburgh.

- I'm maintaining [RisingLight](https://github.com/risinglightdb/risinglight), an educational OLAP database system.
- I worked on [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub) as a teaching assistant for [@cmu-db](https://github.com/cmu-db)'s intro to database course when I was in Carnegie Mellon University.
- I'm interested in exploring how to productively use the Rust programming language in data-intensive applications.
    - In [mini-lsm](https://github.com/skyzh/mini-lsm), you will learn how to build a LSM-tree storage engine in Rust.
    - In [type-exercise-in-rust](https://github.com/skyzh/type-exercise-in-rust), you will learn how to build a vectorized expression evaluation framework in database systems with Rust.
    - In [write-you-a-vector-db](https://github.com/skyzh/write-you-a-vector-db), you will add vector extensions to a relational database system.

Fuku Tea closing on August...
- You can sponsor me to build better database systems, craft wonderful education materials, and explore how the Rust programming language fits in the database world.
- ... by buying me [bubble tea in Pittsburgh](https://www.toasttab.com/fuku-tea/giftcards), which makes me productive when coding.
